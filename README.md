# fft_simd
A simple demo shows how to use the SIMD,Single Instruction Multiple Data, to optimize and accelerate the FFT algorithm.

	* -Task 1. Implement standard DFT algorithm with C++.
	* Task 2. Rewrite the DFT with Cooleyâ€“Tukey FFT algorithm.
	* Task 3. Ues SIMD to accelerate the FFT alogrithm.
	* Task 4. Make a time consuming contrast among these algorithms.
